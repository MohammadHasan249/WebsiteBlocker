# WebsiteBlocker
Runs in the background 24/7 and checks whether the current time is in between the specific "working" hours, and blocks the website if it is, and unblocks if it isn't.


The "hosts" file attached was just a test file to see if my code was actually working on an arbitrary hosts file.
Once I confirmed that it did, I changed the path to the Windows hosts file stored in my computer.

Feel free to clone this project, and try it out for yourself!

Adapted it from the Udemy course, "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications"!
